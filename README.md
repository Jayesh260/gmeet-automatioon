# gmeet-automatioon
A small project to automate the google meet joining the specific meet on specific time. using the already pre existing libraries.
firstly the project asks the user the id and pass for the gmeet.
then it verifies that the provided id and pass are correct or not.
if its correct then it asks the google meet code for joining.
then it checks if its correct or not.
if its correct then it asks the date and time for the meet.
then it starts the reverse countdown for the meet and when the timer hits zero it will start chrome and enter id and pass and then the code and joins the meet with closed camera and microphone.
